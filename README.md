### A Little Bit About Me

I have first started programing when I was in 6th grade (12-13 y.o.). I was writing scripts for Minecraft PE (in simple text editor, BTW). 

After then I started participating in competitions, learning new technologies, using those for my projects. 
Programming is specially fun, when you have real problem you face and you can solve it through code 😊
