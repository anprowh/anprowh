### Hi there 👋

I am Computer Science student in ITMO University 🎓

I like to develop scripts and programs 💻

### My skills

Here is a list of my skills, habits and little descriptions so you can understand my level

- Maths - I have participated and got some results on Olympiads. Performing well in the University
- OOP - Have experience working with it
